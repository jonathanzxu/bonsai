      NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<Your NextAuth secret>
      NEXTAUTH_URL=<Your NextAuth URL>
      GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<Your Google Client ID>
      GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<Your Google Client Secret>
      ```

    - Replace the placeholders with your actual values. Here's how you can obtain each of these:

        - **MongoDB connection string**: This is provided by MongoDB Atlas. After creating an account and a new cluster, the connection string can be found under the "Connect" option of your cluster. Ensure to replace `<password>` with your database user password and `<dbname>` with the name of your database.

        - **NextAuth secret**: This is a secret used to encrypt session data. A random string can be generated for this purpose. There are many ways to generate a random string, one of them is to use an online random string generator.

        - **NextAuth URL**: This is the base URL of your application. During development, it's usually `http://localhost:3000`.

        - **Google Client ID and Google Client Secret**: These are provided by Google Cloud Platform. After creating a new project and setting up the OAuth consent screen, credentials for the OAuth client ID can be created.
